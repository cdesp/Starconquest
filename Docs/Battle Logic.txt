Example1

500 ST1 attack 300 ST1a

Attacker attack result
Defender loses 100 ST1a

Defender attack result
Attacker loses 75 ST1

On Next Round
Attacker will have 500-75 ST1
Defender will have 300-100 ST1a

Attacker attack result
Defender loses 80 ST1a

Defender attack result
Attacker loses 50 ST1

On Next Round
Attacker will have 500-75-50 ST1
Defender will have 300-100-80 ST1a


Example2

500 ST1 attack 20 ST1a

Attacker attack result
Defender loses 20 ST1a

Attacker fired with 200 ST1 to completly defeat defender ST1a
so that leaves 300 ST1 that can fire to another Ship type of defender

300 ST1 attack 200 ST2a
Attacker attack result
Defender loses 50 ST2a

Defender(ST1a) attack result
Attacker loses 5 ST1

On Next Round
Attacker will have 500-5 ST1 (minus whatever else the defender destroyes during his attack)
Defender will have 0 ST1a
Defender will have 200-50 ST2a
